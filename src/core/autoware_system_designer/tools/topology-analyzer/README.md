# topology-analyzer

Two-script tool for capturing and comparing ROS 2 system graphs.
Useful for verifying that a refactored launch configuration matches a reference system, or for auditing what changed between two software versions.

## Scripts

| Script                    | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ros2_graph_snapshot.py`  | Connects to a live ROS 2 system and snapshots its node graph to JSON               |
| `ros2_topology_report.py` | Generates a human-readable report from one snapshot, or a structured diff from two |

Both scripts are standalone Python files with no build step required.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Capture snapshots

Run this while each system is live. Each call produces a `graph.json`.

```bash
# While system A is running:
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py --out /tmp/snap_a/graph.json --spin-seconds 3.0

# While system B is running:
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py --out /tmp/snap_b/graph.json --spin-seconds 3.0
```

The script connects to the ROS 2 graph, waits `--spin-seconds` for node discovery to settle, then records every node's publishers, subscribers, services, clients, and (optionally) parameter names and values.

### 2. Single-system report

```bash
python3 ros2_topology_report.py /tmp/snap_a/graph.json --out /tmp/topology_a.md
```

Groups nodes by their pub/sub/service/client signature and lists all topics with types.
Common infrastructure topics (`/rosout`, `/clock`, `/parameter_events`) are hidden by default to reduce noise.
If the snapshot has `component_info` data (taken with an updated snapshot script), a **Composable Node Containers** section lists every `ComponentManager` container and its composable nodes.

### 3. Diff two systems

```bash
python3 ros2_topology_report.py /tmp/snap_a/graph.json /tmp/snap_b/graph.json --out /tmp/diff.md
```

Matches nodes between the two snapshots — name-agnostic, so nodes that were renamed or moved to a different namespace are still paired by topology similarity — then reports:

- **Namespace Summary** — per-namespace counts of added/removed/changed nodes
- **Container Changes** — (when component data present) containers added/removed, and which composable nodes joined or left each container
- **Matching summary** — all matched node pairs with similarity scores
- **Added nodes** — nodes in the new system with no match in the old
- **Removed nodes** — nodes in the old system with no match in the new
- **Changed nodes** — matched nodes whose endpoints or parameters differ, tagged by change type
- **Edge-level changes** — added/removed/renamed pub→sub connections on topics

| `executor_type`     | string \| null  | `"single_threaded"`, `"multi_threaded"`, or `"isolated"` for component containers; `null` for standalone nodes (executor is internal to the process)  |
| `cmdline`           | list of strings | Full command line as seen in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`                                                                                                    |

| `component_classes` | list \| null    | For component containers: every `rclcpp_components` plugin class whose library is loaded, resolved from the ament index. `null` for standalone nodes. |

`process` is `null` when the node's process could not be matched (e.g. running on a remote host, or launched without explicit `--ros-args -r __node:=` remapping). Use `--no-process` to omit this field entirely.

`component_info` is `null` for standalone nodes (launched as separate processes).
It is populated for composable nodes loaded into a `ComponentManager` container.
If `composition_interfaces` is not available on the system, all `component_info` entries will be `null`.

## Diff output reference

### Container Changes

Only present when at least one snapshot contains `component_info` data (i.e., the snapshot was taken with a build that has `composition_interfaces` available).

```text
## Container Changes

- Standalone nodes: 12 -> 10
- Containers: 4 -> 5

### Added containers
- /sensing/lidar/new_container (3 nodes): /sensing/lidar/top/node_a, /sensing/lidar/top/node_b, ...

### Removed containers
- /old/lidar_container (2 nodes): /sensing/lidar/left/old_node_x, /sensing/lidar/left/old_node_y

### Changed containers (membership differs)
#### /pointcloud_container (+2 joined, -1 left)

- joined: /sensing/lidar/new_node  [new node]
- joined: /sensing/lidar/moved_node  [from /old/lidar_container]
- left:   /sensing/lidar/split_node  [now in /sensing/lidar/new_container]
```

### Namespace Summary

Quick overview of which namespaces have activity:

```text
- /perception/object_recognition:      +3 added, ~10 changed
- /perception/traffic_light_recognition: -22 removed
- /sensing/lidar:                      +6 added, -16 removed, ~9 changed
```

### Changed node tags

Each changed node entry is tagged with the kinds of differences found:

| Tag             | Meaning                                                                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[structural]`  | Publishers, subscribers, service servers, or clients were added or removed                         |
| `[remapped]`    | The node or its topics were renamed/moved to a different namespace; message types unchanged        |
| `[param-name]`  | Parameter names were added or removed                                                              |
| `[param-value]` | Parameter values changed                                                                           |
| `[container]`   | The composable container the node runs in changed, or the node moved between standalone/composable |

Example:

```text
### /sensing/lidar/top/distortion_corrector_node -> /sensing/lidar/top/distortion_corrector_node [structural, remapped, param-name, param-value]
- subscribers:
  - removed: /sensing/lidar/top/mirror_cropped/pointcloud_ex
  - added:   /sensing/lidar/top/crop_box_filter_wheels/output
- parameter values:
  - changed: output_frame :: velodyne_top -> base_link

### /some/node -> /some/node [container]
- component:
  - container: /old_container -> /new_container
```

For composable-to-standalone transitions:

```text
### /some/node -> /some/node [container]
- component:
  - standalone -> composable in /pointcloud_container (id=3)
```

### Edge-level changes

Edges are pub→sub connections through a topic. Three categories:

- **Renamed edges** (`~`) — same publisher and subscriber nodes, only the topic name changed (a topic rename, not a topology change)
- **Added edges** (`+`) — new connections in the new system
- **Removed edges** (`-`) — connections present in the old system but not the new

```text
~ /perception/obstacle_segmentation/common_ground_filter
    -> /perception/occupancy_grid_map/occupancy_grid_map_node
    : /perception/obstacle_segmentation/single_frame/pointcloud
   -> /perception/obstacle_segmentation/pointcloud

+ /sensing/lidar/left/lidar -> /sensing/lidar/left/crop_box_filter_self : /sensing/lidar/left/lidar/velodyne_points
- /sensing/lidar/left/velodyne_ros_wrapper_node -> /sensing/lidar/left/crop_box_filter_self : /sensing/lidar/left/pointcloud_raw_ex
```

## Limitations

**Plugin class resolution uses the ament index, not the live DDS graph.**
The ROS 2 graph API does not expose the C++ plugin class name at runtime.
The snapshot resolves plugin classes by cross-referencing the loaded `.so` files in the container process (`/proc/<pid>/maps`) against the ament resource index (`share/ament_index/resource_index/rclcpp_components`).
This correctly identifies _which classes are registered in the loaded libraries_ but cannot determine _which specific instance of a duplicate class_ a given composable node represents when multiple nodes of the same type run inside the same container.
`component_classes` on a composable node entry lists all classes available in the container process — not just the one backing that particular node.

**Nodes without `--ros-args` remappings have `process: null`.**
When a node is launched without explicit `__node:=` / `__ns:=` remapping arguments, the snapshot tool cannot correlate it to a running process by command-line inspection alone.
This is uncommon in production launch configurations (where remappings are always set) but can occur with manually started nodes.

---

## Node matching algorithm (diff mode)

Nodes are matched across the two snapshots in ordered passes, from strongest evidence to weakest:

1. **Same fully-qualified name** — exact name match; fast path
2. **Exact interface/signature match** — identical pub/sub/service/client interface sets and types (catches simple node renames)
3. **Normalized/interface-derived match** — compares normalized names and interface structure to catch namespace moves and similar refactors
4. **Type-composition / interface-composition match** — uses the mix of endpoint types and interface makeup to pair nodes that remain structurally the same even when names changed more substantially
5. **Fuzzy similarity fallback** — only after the stronger deterministic passes fail, the matcher scores remaining candidates using a weighted combination of name and interface-overlap signals, then requires a mutual best match with sufficient separation from the next-best candidate

Nodes matched in an earlier pass are not reconsidered by later passes. Topology changes in matched nodes are still reported.

The exact pass order, scoring weights, and tie-break thresholds are implementation details of `lib/matching.py`; if you need to interpret a borderline match precisely, treat the code as the source of truth rather than the simplified summary above.
Standard ROS 2 parameter management services (`describe_parameters`, `get_parameters`, etc.) are suppressed from the services diff when the node itself was renamed, since those renames are purely derivative.

## Typical use cases

**Verify a refactor did not change topology:**

```bash
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py --out /tmp/before/graph.json
# ... apply refactor and restart ...
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py --out /tmp/after/graph.json
python3 ros2_topology_report.py /tmp/before/graph.json /tmp/after/graph.json
# Expect: 0 structural changes, only [remapped] changes if any topics were renamed
```

**Snapshot a single subsystem:**

```bash
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py \
    --filter '^/perception/' \
    --params none \
    --spin-seconds 2.0 \
    --out /tmp/perception.json
python3 ros2_topology_report.py /tmp/perception.json
```

**Diff without parameter noise (faster snapshot, less output):**

```bash
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py --params none --out /tmp/snap_a.json
python3 ros2_graph_snapshot.py --params none --out /tmp/snap_b.json
python3 ros2_topology_report.py /tmp/snap_a.json /tmp/snap_b.json
```
